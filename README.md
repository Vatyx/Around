# CodeFit

CodeFit allows you to fully discover a language by unlocking achievements.
Like in gaming, achievements encourage you to explore the entire features of the programing language.

CodeFit analyzes all of your github repos to get you started and suggests which achievements to tackle next. We also developed an atom plugin that automatically analyzes the code to instantly let you know when an achievement has been unlocked. With this beginners are able to quickly learn program terminology since they'll know they first time they try something new (ie callbacks). Codefit also enourages experts to explore new features they didn’t know existed.


###Current Solutions

#### CodeCademy
- Code you write is only for an exercise. Being told what to write.
- Don’t know where to start. More advanced users could waste a lot of time going though the initial excercies.

#### Regular Side Projects
- Can get stuck doing the same thing with the language (i.e. callbacks)
- No incentive to try new things (old stuff works).


CodeFit: Tells you exactly what you don’t know. So you can learn it in the context of your own project.


### Next Steps
- Crowdsourced achievements.
- Ignore modules during initial code analysis
- Verify all code was written by author
